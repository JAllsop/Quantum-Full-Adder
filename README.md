# Full Stack Quantum Computing - Quantum Full Adder  
This notebook details the implementation and analysis of a quantum full adder of 3 and 5 bits. A Full Adder is a classical circuit, composed of logic gates, designed to add two binary numbers. The addition of numbers forms the basis for arithmetic operations - subtraction is the reverse of addition, multiplication is successive addition etc. Meaning, the full adder (and circuits like it) is a vital component of modern (classical) computation.  

It is computationally inefficient to emulate classical gates in quantum computing as it does not take advantage of quantum speedup and the Quantum Volume scales too rapidly. However, this is a good demonstration of the various functions of quantum gates, utilsing real world Quantum Computers and a good bridging point for those familiar with classical computing.
